Welcome to Anquestria. It is very much a work in progress, but should be fully playable.

A great deal more work can be done, and anypony that wants to help is welcome, so if you want to help out, contact me at anquestria@gmail.com

Development progress can be followed at anquestria.blogspot.com


Aquestria 0.1 changelist (things different from Angband 3.2):
Player races changed entirely
Shop owners changed
Character descriptions during character creation changed entirely
Glove encumberance for arcane casters changed to helm encumberance (can't cast as well with a covered horn, unless it is made for casters)
Executable icon and name changed
The Phial of Celestia artifact name change



List of easy work upcoming:
Retheming artifacts
Retheming monsters
Retheming ego items (Elvenkind to Pegasi or something)
Updating help files (currently reference Angband races)
Disabling some classes for some races (no pegasi/earth pony casters, for example)

List of work remaining to take this from an Angband reskin to a full variant:
Creating new artifacts
Creating new classes
Creating new spells
Creating new mechanics (flight, etc)
